# Final project proposal

### Whale migration along the West Coast

This semester, I have a rough idea of visualizing animal migration (and the barriers to it) in California. My initial plan was to look at three species: the gray whale, the monarch butterfly, and a shorebird. But I've realized this is a little too ambitious. By far, the most data available is for marine mammals.

The National Stranding Network, which is a subset of NOAA Fisheries, keeps a record of every killed or injured marine mammal that is spotted by volunteers or scientists in its [National Stranding Database](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/marine-life-distress/national-stranding-database-public-access). I have already submitted a query to the database and receieved data on gray whale strandings along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington since 2006. I am requesting earlier data, and expect to get it, though I've been told it might be a mess.

Additionally, one of the lead scientists at the Cetacean Health and Life History Program (another subset of NOAA Fisheries) has conveyed his willingness to share with me sattelite [tracking data](https://swfsc.noaa.gov/MMTD-GrayWhale-tracking/) his team has collected from tagging gray whales.

My goal would be to map the gray whale stranding and tracking data in relation to the shipping lanes that run north and south along the U.S. coast from the San Francisco Bay. The state of California keeps shapefiles of the shipping lanes on its [Geoportal](http://portal.gis.ca.gov/geoportal/catalog/search/resource/details.page?uuid=%7B953E7DF6-987F-4613-8117-ADEDDBD4D21E%7D) website.

Right now, my main concern is finding the data I need. Ideally, I would want data from before and after 2003, when the shipping lanes were changed in response to increased collisions with whales. Additionally, it would be possible for me to look at more than simply the gray whale. The National Stranding Database includes data on a range of marine life, from sea turtles to humpbacks.

This combination of data might help visualize answers to a range of questions: Does one species of whale collide with ships more often than others? Did the shipping lanes' shift in 2003 correlate with a decrease in injuries and deaths? Or, even more nuanced: In an era of climate disruption where animals are altering their migration patterns, is the idea of a static shipping lane enough to protect them?
